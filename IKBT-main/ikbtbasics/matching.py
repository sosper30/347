# Dianmu Zhang
# matching function: this method groups specific joint
# solutions ('notations', e.g. th_1s4) into the correct sets:
#
# [
# [th1s01, th2s01, th3_s01, th4s01 ... etc ],
# [th1s02, th2s02, th3_s02, th4s01 ... etc ],
# etc ....
# ]
#
# which is what control software requires for correct poses
# How to use:
# insert "final_groups = matching_func(R.notation_collections,
# R.solution_nodes)"
# after the BT is ticked, and solution_graph is generated
# example, in test_Robots_new.py line 351
