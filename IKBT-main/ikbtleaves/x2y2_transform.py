#     BT Nodes for Testing, ID, Solving

#   Solve using the x^2 + y^2 method Craig uses
#      for puma joint 2 (eqn 4.65 p 118)
#
#    BH    2/2/17
#
#    BH : Dec-21:  SIMPLIFY!    After squaring and summing,
#       if a one-unk equation is identified, just add
#       it to the list of one-unk equations (in a persistent way).
#
#     To reflect this change we rename it to x2y2_transform!

#     also please forgive occasional references to x2z2 instead of x2y2
#        they are the same!!
